WhoDat Project
==============

The WhoDat project is a front-end for whoisxmlapi data, or any whois data
living in a MongoDB. It integrates whois data, current IP resolutions and
passive DNS. In addition to providing an interactive, pivotable application
for analysts to perform research, it also has an API which will allow output
in JSON or list format.

WhoDat was originally written by [Chris Clark](https://github.com/Xen0ph0n).
The original implementation is in PHP and available in this repository under
the [legacy_whodat](../master/legacy_whodat) directory. The code was re-written
from scratch by [Wesley Shields](https://github.com/wxsBSD) and
[Murad Khan](https://github.com/mraoul) in Python, and is available under the
[pydat](../master/pydat) directory.

The PHP version is left for those who want to run it, but it is not as full
featured or extensible as the Python implementation, and is not supported.

For more information on the PHP implementation please see the [readme](../master/legacy_whodat/README.md). For more information on the Python implementation
keep reading...

pyDat
=====

pyDat is a Python implementation of [Chris Clark's](https://github.com/Xen0ph0n)
WhoDat code. It is designed to be more extensible and has more features than
the PHP implementation.

Running pyDat
=============

pyDat does not provide any data on its own. You must provide your own whois
data in a MongoDB. Beyond the data in a MongoDB you will need
[Django](https://djangoproject.com), [pymongo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/),
and [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) (at least 2.2.1).

Populating Mongo with whoisxmlapi data (Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS)
===========================================================

- Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
- Download latest trimmed (smallest possible) whoisxmlapi quarterly DB dump.
- Extract the csv files.
- Create an index on domainName:
```bash
$ mongo
use whois
db.whois.ensureIndex( {domainName: 1, unique:true} )
```
- Import them (adjust for your needs):
```
for file in */*.csv; do echo $file && mongoimport --db whois --collection whois --file $file --type csv --headerline --upsert --upsertFields domainName; done
```
- Create indexes on registrant_name, contactEmail and registrant_telephone.
```bash
$ mongo
use whois
db.whois.ensureIndex( {contactEmail: 1} )
db.whois.ensureIndex( {registrant_name: 1} )
db.whois.ensureIndex( {registrant_telephone: 1} )
db.whois.ensureIndex( {registrant_email: 1} )
db.whois.ensureIndex( {registrarName: 1} )

```
- Copy pydat to /var/www/ (or prefered location)
- Copy pydat/custom_settings_example.py to pydat/custom_settings.py.
- Edit pydat/custom_settings.py to suit your needs.
  - Include your DNSDB key if you have one!
- Configure Apache to use the provided wsgi interface to pydat.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/whois

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName whois
        ServerAlias whois
        # Install Location
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/pydat/wsgi.py
        Alias /static/ /var/www/pydat/pydat/static/
        <Location "/static/">
            Options -Indexes
        </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

Untested Stuff
=============

Chris has an update.py script which I haven't used yet, so all bets are off,
but it should allow you to get regular updates on specific watched fields via
a cron job. For more information please see the [PHP implementation](../master/whodat).

TODO
====

- Move Chris' update script to a common directory and test it out.
- Find a way to implement historical searches.
